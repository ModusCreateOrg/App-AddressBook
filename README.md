# Modus Create / Dream Factory Address Book Application

This repository contains the source code to an address book and contact list management tool
deployable on Dream Factory's cloud infrastructure and using their API.

The suite of tools here include an ExtJS 4 based desktop administrative application and a Sencha Touch 2 based
mobile application with profiles for phone and tablet.

Both the desktop and mobile applications share a common ExtJS/Touch (works for both!) class for accessing the
Dream Factory API.
